# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Added offline Office DSL MVP workspace using pnpm workspaces.
- Added `@office-dsl/dsl-model` with `office.dsl.v1` JSON model, parser, structural validation, and human-readable DSL rendering.
- Added `@office-dsl/dsl-runtime` with state machine, policy engine, action registry, dry-run execution, confirmations, clarification answers, plan hashing, file task store, and audit records.
- Added `@office-dsl/llm-planner` with default mock planning and optional OpenRouter planning path.
- Added CLI commands for planning, validation, inspection, answers, confirmation, rejection, execution, and history.
- Added backend API and static web demo using the same runtime as the CLI.
- Added Python verifier package with mock verification and optional LiteLLM/OpenRouter path.
- Added mock data and six example scenarios.
- Added TypeScript, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier, pnpm workspace, and Python verifier configuration.
- Added architecture documentation, research migration audit, handoff notes, and version metadata.

### Changed

- Moved historical research folders into `research/` and verified historical file contents as byte-identical.
- Updated documentation to describe the current MVP implementation instead of only the original documentation standard.
- Treated `project.sh` as historical context, not as the active MVP bootstrap.

### Fixed

- Fixed repository documentation links that pointed at old research folder locations.
- Added ignore rules for Python caches, pytest cache directories, generated runtime output, pnpm store, and mock outbox.

### Security

- Added deterministic policy checks for blocked shell/dynamic-code patterns, path traversal, unsafe email operations, and confirmation requirements.
- Added tests covering path traversal blocking, absence of `eval`/`new Function` in mock output, prompt-injection-as-data behavior, dry-run email sending, and confirmation hash reuse prevention.
- Kept mock mode as the validated default; no real external email/API action is performed by tests.

### Known limitations

- Full Intent/Contract DSL is not complete.
- Bilateral contract approval and contract finalization are not implemented.
- Conversation and file-guidelines inputs are not implemented as first-class planner modes.
- Example regeneration and diff runner is not implemented.
- OpenRouter and LiteLLM code paths are optional but not tested in this offline MVP pass.
- Linux compatibility is not verified in this run.
- Python tests passed with one pytest cache warning caused by a cache directory write denial; test assertions passed.

### Validation note

- Final validation note: an earlier full Vitest run passed 15/15, but a later final rerun in this Codex session failed before test collection because local pnpm links in `node_modules` could not resolve `@vitest/utils`. No install was run after the user requested not to rerun install. Manual relink attempts were not committed because `node_modules` is ignored. The next operator should refresh dependencies with `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and rerun the final validation.
